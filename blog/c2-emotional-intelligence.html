    <h2> Learnings from chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself:</h2>
      <p>Lots. Really like the affect labelling technique - it's one I've been practicing without knowing it. Labeling an emotion activates the executive centre of my brain, which deactivates the amygdala, the part responsible for our "fight or flight" responses.</p>
    <h2> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>A bit boring. I think I might have mild ADHD haha. Finding it hard to focus won't stop fidgetting. Will try again later.</p>
