      <h2>My Technical Blog 1</h2>

        <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
        <p>An analogy that comes to my mind is comparing it to a meal: HTML is the food or ingredient that is edible. An apple is edible and you can eat it on its own, but you can do many other things with it to make it interesting and enticing to eat! CSS is the cooking involved. Who would want to eat just an apple they could eat an apple pie instead? Or even as a part of a fruit platter? DOM stands for Document Object Model. This is a way of linking html documents with CSS documents. DOM is like the recipe showing you the steps to make an apple pie. Just like the receipe, it is a description of the process to create the apple pie, rather than actually giving you the pie itself.</p>
        <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
        <p>Boxifying design means that you should first identify the area you wish to design by putting a box (be it square or oblong) around the area. Keep adding boxes around, inside or over the area until you are able to create the design you want.</p>
        <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
        <p>The box model is using the boxes which you have identified you wish to design and then focusing one box at a time.</p>

      <h2>Wishlist for my website from CSS Zen Garden</h2>
        <h3>style 124 - Green Tea</h3>
          <p>This style has a nice patterned background and the curly leaf design is very elegant.</p>
        <h3>style 206 - Muddy Boot Trail</h3>
          <p>This style fits the theme of my blog because I am on a "journey". I really like the boots for bullet points on the right hand side of the page.</p>
        <h3>style 191 - Journal/Diary</h3>
          <p>I love the diary or journal look of this page. It feels like the reader is reading a book and the read bookmark on the top right is a nice touch. However, I feel that this page is split in the middle and loses an opportunity to grab the reader's attention.</p>
        <h3>style 217 - Magazine</h3>
          <p>This style is simple and effective. I like the nice balance of color blocking different boxes. A very magazine feel which I like.</p>
