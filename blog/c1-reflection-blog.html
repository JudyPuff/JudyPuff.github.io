      <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
        <p>I guess I have high expectations for this experience as I've heard many good things about it.</p>

      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
        <p>My impressions of it is that it is filled with positive people who will encourage me to learn.</p>

      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
        <p> I think I will find it hard to share my struggles with others as I come from a background of presenting my perfect self to others all the time.</p>

      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
        <p> Yes. I thought I was basically going to rely a lot on the help of the instructor but the peer learning through the Slack channel is actually really good! I'm loving how everyone is so willing to help each other on slack!</p>

      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
        <p>Yes and Yes.</p>
