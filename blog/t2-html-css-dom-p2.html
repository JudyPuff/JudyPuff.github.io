    <h2>Technical Blog 2 (Reflections on CSS)</h2>

      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
        <p>Designing a website based on a grid or boxes layout.</p>

      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
        <p>Responsive design is becoming more and more relevant because people don't just look at screens (with similar pixels) on a desktop computer any more. There are different resolutions (different pixels) on different devices such as a smartphone or tablet. Therefore, the web pages you design must be "responsive" to the device the user is using.</p>

      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
        <p>A "tag" (usually with < > brackets around it) that describes the part of the webpage. For example: <link> means you are linking a folder to this page - like links to my other blogs at the top of this page!</p>

      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
        <p>I'm one of those unusual people who are allergic to math (anything with numbers and weird signs to be precise) so I was a bit freaked out when I first learned that you have to calculate the percentage of the screen your columns will take up. I've drawn a table for myself (lucky there's only 12 columns!) and pinned it to the wall so I can try and memorise it.</p>
