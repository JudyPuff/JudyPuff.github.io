        <h2>Code-Hearted Lawyer turned Cyber Security Nerd</h2>
        <p>I have a confession to make: I was a lawyer for 6 years (right now, I'm allowed to call myself an "Enrolled Barrister of the High Court of New Zealand" which means I can witness documents like a JP but NOT give legal advice). I still love the law but I wanted to learn a new skill when I turned 30 so I enrolled in a coding bootcamp with Enspiral Dev Academy.</p><br>
          
        <p>Being the easily-distracted person that I am, I got really interested in cybersecurity while I learned to code. I attended BSides Wellington in 2017 on a sponsored diversity programme and I was hooked. I "networked" (people, not wires) and eventually landed my first tech and cybersecurity job as a Security Engineer.</p><br>

        <p>I initially made this website as a part of my Enspiral Dev Academy project to blog about my web dev journey but I think this is more than that now. I miss writing and this is my slice of the internet that I want to keep writing in. If you'd like to have a discussion with me, feel free to hit me up on twitter @judyofcare and I'll do my best to respond!</p><br>
