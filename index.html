        <h2>Tech Witch. Lawyer. Banana</h2>
        <p>I'm currently studying web dev at Enspiral Dev Academy. I decided to learn web dev because a really cool programmer (she had purple hair - so of course she's cool!) told me that programming is the closest thing we have to magic. I still believe in magic. So I quit my job as a lawyer and I want to do magic. Read about my web dev journey!</p><br>

        <p>I'm also a banana...that's a term for people who look Asian but don't act or talk very "Asian" (whatever that means). I was born in Taiwan (yes, now you know where I'm "from-from") but I grew up in Auckland, New Zealand and identify myself as <em>"kiwi-asian"</em>.</p><br>

        <p>Oh, and the "Edwards" part of my name comes from my husband - James Ting-Edwards. Did you know that in NZ, you can start using your married name as soon as you are married? You don't need to officially register it - just have a proof of your marriage certificate when official-sounding people ask for it.</p>
