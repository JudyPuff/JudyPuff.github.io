        <p>Reflections on chapter 3 of Search Inside Yourself</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></li>
          <p>Coming from a legal background, a mindfulness conversation is very similar to a client interview. Looping is another term for active listening which lawyers often use to check whether they have the right instructions from their clients. Having had interview room experience as a lawyer this is actually quite easy for me. I did the conversation with my mother and she found it similar to when I tested client interviewing techniques on her back at law school.</p>

          <li><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></li>
          <p>I will try all three but I think it is easiest to sustain the third technique: take one mindful breath a day. I've already done one before writing this blog!</p>

          <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
          <p>I really liked the comparison of focused and open attention to athlete circuit training - intense cardio and resistence training in 1 session. </p>
