        <h1>Technical Blog 4 - JavaScript</h1>
        <p>Discussing with a non-tech friend:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS</li>
          <p>Much, much harder. But much, much more useful! It is like the engine of a car. It can make calculations and take you from A to B whereas HTML and CSS looks at the presentation of the machine. </p>

          <li>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life,for example 'waking up or 'brushing your teeth'.</li>
          <p>Not sure if I understand control flow very well but I see it as a check list. If your 'To Do' list for today is to 'wake up' and 'brush your teeth' the flow statements are your check list to see if they are done. Loop is just like repeating the same checklist for the next day. </p>

          <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</li>
          <p>Arrays is just a fancy word for <strong>lists</strong> and objects is a fancy word for a <strong>category of things</strong>. When you are accessing items on you list, you are accessing data (another fancy word for things for information). If you are accessing objects, you are accessing a whole category of similar things (e.g. my toys). </p>

          <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</li>
          <p>Funcstions are a block of code that makes stuff happen. You can define something or define a category of things but you need a block of function code to take you from A to B. Functions are useful because they can change the original input to create the desired result/output.</p>
