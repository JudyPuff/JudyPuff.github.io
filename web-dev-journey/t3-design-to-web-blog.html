        <p>Discussing with a non-tech friend:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</li>
          <p>A responsive site is a website that reacts to the screen size. Not all screens have the same pixels (pixels are little lights that light up in different ways to make the words and images that you can see on your screen) and so a web designer will have to design their website on different canvases. This is important because nowadays people use different size screens and you want the same information on your website to be displayed on all screens.</p>

          <li>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</li>
          <p>Mobile first is design is when web developers design a website to be seen on a mobile/smartphone screen. In the past, the websites are made, and are viewed on desktop computers. Desktop computers have mostly similar sized screens. However, nowadays more people are using their mobile phones to access the internet and so web designers respond to the trend by designing a website to be used on the mobile phone first.</p>

          <li>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</li>
          <p>Frameworks are bits of code that almost all designers (of a similar website) need to use to create a skeleton website. This makes the process of making a website much faster and allows web designers to go straight to designing the website rather than spend a long time setting up the skeleton.</p>

          <li>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</li>
          <p>Wireframe is a rough sketch (in black and white) of what your website will look like. Like my site plan below:</p><br>
          <img src="/images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="blawg-site-wireframe-image">
          <br>

          <li>What aspects of your wireframe did you find difficult to implement, and why.</li>
          <p>I found the nav bar at the top of my wireframe difficult to implement as that was not specifically taught. However, I searched it on w3 school and I love the nav bar I have now. Another hard bit about my wireframe is the Relative Random Musings sidebar on the right. I again searched w3school and found how to do it. Seeing how the professionals do it helped me understand how to translate the grid system into code.</p>
