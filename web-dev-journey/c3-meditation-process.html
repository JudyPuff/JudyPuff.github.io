        <h2>Process over Product</h2>
        <h3>How did the process over production concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>It gave me a structure actually. Really enjoyed this sprint as I had a vague idea of an end product I wanted but didn't know how to get there. However, if I focus on the process, it firstly made it less scary and secondly it takes you down a success spiral. I mean success spiral because it is addictive when you acheive one section of what you want to do and can immediately see how cool it looked.</p>
