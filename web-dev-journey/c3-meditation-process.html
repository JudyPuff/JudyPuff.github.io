        <h2>Process over Product</h2>
        <h3>How did the process over production concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>It gave me a structure actually. Really enjoyed this sprint as I had a vague idea of an end product I wanted but didn't know how to get there. However, if I focus on the process, it firstly made it less scary and secondly it takes you down a success spiral. I mean success spiral because it is addictive when you acheive one section of what you want to do and can immediately see how cool it looked.</p>

        <h2>Meditation Process - Reflections on Chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself</h2>

        <ol>
          <h3><li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</li></h3>
          <p>Boring. I can't stop fidgeting or scratching my face. Felt like an idiot sitting on the rug in the living room.</p>
          <h3><li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</li></h3>
          <p>Couple of things: that happiness is the default feeling of humans, and that meditation can cure psoriasis! Well - correlation not causation.</p>
          <h3><li>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</li></h3>
          <p>That it's ok to scratch yourself when meditating...but you just have to think about it before you do. Don't judge yourself that you have to scratch or fidget.</p>
          <h3><li>Any other musings?</li></h3>
          <p>No.</p>
