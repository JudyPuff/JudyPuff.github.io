        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>Reflections on chapter 6 of Search Inside Yourself</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></li>
            
            <p>It should really be purpose, passion and pleasure sense. I think the word should be 'contentment' rather than happiness (yes, I know in French happy is 'content' but in English, content is more like 'satisfied'). Nevertheless, in answering the question what life looks like, I understand that life is cyclical and that if we are content with ourselves, and have an intrinsic motivation to be good at our work, we'd be good at our work. If we are good at our work, we do more (increasing frequency), which gets us closer to our purpose or reason for being content in the first place. Got it!</p>

        <li><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</strong></li>
        <ul>
        <li><strong> What are your core values?</strong></li>
            <p>My core values are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Community and a sense of belonging</li>
                <p>I grew up feeling like I was a misfit. That coming to NZ was a mistake because I look different and I speak a different language. As I grow up, I find that there are many people like me. Even people born in NZ feel the same way.</p>

                <li>Recipricate Caring (for those I love)</li>
                <p>Because I never had close family in NZ, I learned to love my friends. I have a bunch of very close friends who have been with me through thick and thin. Instead of just using the word love, I want to specify that I want to recipricate caring for them, as they have done for me.</p>

                <li>Open Mindedness</li>
                <p>I would not be where I am without the open-mindedness of those around me. Even to initiate a 'Hello, how are you?' to me, you are being open-minded. I might look like just another, short, asian woman in a predominately English (sometimes Maori) country but I am also unique. Conversely, I make an effort to learn about the people I meet. I am open-minded about their background and their experiences. I do not judge. There's not Judge Judy. Just Judy. That's me.</p>
            </ol>

        <li><strong> What do you stand for?</strong></li>
            <p>I stand for:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Friendship</li>
                <p>Again. I am a fierce and loyal friend. I value the attention people give me. And I want to return that time they give me. Or to pay it forward. My friends are my world.</p>

                <li>Happiness</li>
                <p>My philosophy professor (yes I have a philosophy degree) said at my wedding that I light up every room I walk in. He was blind and born without eyeballs. So I'm not sure if he can deferentiate light. But I got what he meant and I want to continue bringing joy everywhere I go...even in a world without him (he passed away a couple of years ago).</p>

                <li>Curiosity</li>
                <p>Part of being curious is being courageous. I want to be brave enough to satisfy my curiosity. I don't want to live through my life thinking about 'what if?'. I want to learn as much as I can about this world in my short time here.</p>
            </ol>
        </ul>      
        <li>Any other musings</li>
        <p>Reading this book is not as philosophically challenging as the theories I studied for my degree. But in some ways I prefer the simplicity and the ease of access to everyday people. </p>
        </ol>
