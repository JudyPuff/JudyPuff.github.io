        <h1>Leadership</h1>
        <p>Reflections on chapter 8 of Search Inside Yourself</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></li>

            <p>Unfortunately I don't really have experience of compassionate leadership in a work context. I do however, have an employer saying to me that she's a 'leader' and that I'm 'the' follower. So my job is not to lead but to grind. My work is just grind, and do my time. I dislike, and am quite frankly, allergic to the word 'leader' and the whole management theory surrounding 'leadership'. However, I can understand why this author uses such a term -- to sell books as this term is on trend at the moment.</p>

        <li><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></li>
        <p>It went well (I think). A good mentor and friend of mine (who passed away recently) said at my wedding that I am like a ray of sunshine. I light up the room I am in. Visualise that ray of sunshine when I talk to people. I want to warm people up.</p>

        <li><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></li>
        <p>Intense. But good. I recently spoke to a friend who has tried so hard to have a child. She and her husband used their last batch of frozen eggs to try to conceive but with no luck. I felt her suffering and disappointment. I imagined how she would have felt. I breathed in her disappointment and I wished that she will be happy, regardless whether she will have children. This is one of my favourite meditations because I feel empowered - that I can send good vibes to her. It's good for my self-confidence to know that I can send well wishes to someone I love. I guess this is like praying. Many of my Christian friends will say that they will 'pray for' someone or something when things are going well. </p>

        <li><strong> How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></li>
        <p>Well, the SCARF model haven't really applied to my Phase 0 experience because so far it has been quite lonely in that I haven't had to work with anyone. I am not sure how it will apply to bootcamp. I just hope there will be a good balance of those things.</p>

        <li><strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</strong></li>

        <p>I really like the different levels of the conversation. Although I'd be inclined to start with the identity conversation first. It seems to me the biggest problem in difficult conversations. There are egos at play and once that's identified the 'difficult' part of the conversation becomes 'easy'.</p>

        <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
        <p>This is the last blog on the Search Inside Yourself book. I am looking forward to bootcamp and utilising what I have learnt. Thank you EDA for making us read this book. It has been fun. :)</p>
