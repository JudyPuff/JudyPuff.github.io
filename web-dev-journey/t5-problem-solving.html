        <h1>Technical Blog 5 - Problem-Solving</h1>
        <p>Discussing with a non-tech friend about a time when you:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Got blocked on a simple problem</li>
          <li>Solved a problem in an elegant way</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In both cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What was the problem?</strong></li>
          <p>I was blocked on assignment 5.4 where we had to write a program which turn the dots blue when you click on it.</p>
          <li><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></li>
          <p>I asked code-help-desk on slack for help. Also asked my husband James, who has a more logical brain than me. Someone on Slack said I should put 'click' instead of 'contextmenu'. I had been copying the code from before without really understanding where I needed to change. James helped by suggesting I use a javascript validator (it's like spell-check for programmers) and it picked up a rogue ( as well as the fact there are no ; at the end of each statement.</p>
          <li><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></li>
          <p>Really frustrated initially. Was starting to think this is not for me. What am I doing here? Why did I spent most of our savings on a course that my brain was simply not wired for? Still a big hit on my self-confidence, even today. </p>
          <li><strong>What did you learn?</strong></li>
          <p>Use a validator when writing. I'm not good at picking up rogue typos and there are programs that do that for me. Using console.log to check what your code does at each step of the way. I should have done the 5.5 Debugging assignment before doing 5.4. I learn that I should just move on to the next assignment if I can't figure out the answer to a current assignment.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Relfect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong></li>
          <p>Not very confident with pseudocode. I think given the open texture of the English language, I could never write a sufficiently unambiguous pseudocode to help. I'd much prefer just commenting what I want to do next.</p>
          <li><strong>Trying something</strong></li>
          <p>This is something that I've been doing and feels like I'm leaving everything to chance when I do it. I keep a record of the different configurations I've tried, like in legal research.</p>
          <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></li>
          <p>I have a small soft toy dugon (sea cow) which my friend bought me from Sydney Aquarium. Its arms hang on the top of the laptop so I can talk to it. Hasn't really worked as I feel like a crazy person talking out loud by myself!</p>
          <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong></li>
          <p>Most of the time I don't understand what the error messages say so I'm not very confident with this technique.</p>
          <li><strong>Console.logging</strong></li>
          <p>I've discovered this technique recently. If only EDA taught me to console.log at each step before the assignment!</p>
          <li><strong>Googling</strong></li>
          <p>I'd have to say this is the technique I'm most confident in. Sometimes however, the answer is given to me when Googling and I feel that I've cheated. I would make sure I understand why the answer works to solve the problem. An example is the check board exercise - using # sign to make a check board.</p>
          <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></li>
          <p>I've only just started using this technique on slack. People are very friendly and are eager to help. I really like how friendly most coders are.</p>
          <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></li>
          <p>Usually I will try this if all of the above has been exhausted. I felt terrible when Harrison said he is looking after about 60 phase 0 students. I hope the teacher-student ratio is not as bad when we get to bootcamp!</p>
          <li><strong>Improving process with reflection</strong></li>
          <p>Haven't really been doing this given that we are 'sprinting' but I know there are things I could do differently if I get to start again!</p>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">JS Array</a>docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>.map()</strong></li>
          <p>This function makes a list (aka 'array' in fancy programming language) of every element (or item on the list) of a function.</p>
          <li><strong>.filter()</strong></li>
          <p>This function only makes a list of the elements if it is true.</p>
          <li><strong>.reduce()</strong></li>
          <p>This function goes through all the every item of a list (aka 'array') and then then put it all into another variable (or box as I'd like to think it)</p>

        </ul>
