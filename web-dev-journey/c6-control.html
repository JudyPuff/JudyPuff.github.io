        <p>Reflections on chapter 5 of Search Inside Yourself</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong></li>
          <p>I think my triggers are fear of failure. If I can't solve a problem, I blame myself for being dumb and I get scared to try, and then I get sad about why I am doing this course in the first place. I tell myself that I'm not a 'mathy' person and that my dad was right in saying programming is for men who are naturally smarter in that way.</p>

          <li><strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong></li>
          <p>Really interesting! I like that you are noticing your emotions by experiencing your body: what does this (emotion) feel like in the body? I feel sad. I feel scared. Breeeeeeeeeeathe. Ok this is good for me. It's ok to be sad and scared. I've been there before. But the main question is how to solve this problem. It's not gonna go away if I drown in this sadness. Let's just get on with it.</p>
