        <p>Reflections on chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></li>
          <p>If you are mindful or aware of your emotions, you are able to be aware of yourself. You are not your emotions. You are simply a container of emotions. They (the emotions) don't define you. </p>

          <li><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></li>
          <p>I tried journalling using the priming method. I think it is more important to leave with the positive emotions at the end. By jornalling the negative emotions/instances you've failed, it is more likely to stick in your mind afterwards. If I have one suggestion on this is to flip it around and journal failed instances first then successful instances so that you will leave the session happier.</p>

          <li><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></li>
          <p>Very well written. I like the anology at the end about emotions are like clouds whilst our core being is like the sky, with clouds being mere phenomena in the sky. Our emotions come and go, but they do not define who we are.</p>
