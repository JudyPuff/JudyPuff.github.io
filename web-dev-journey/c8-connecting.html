        <p>Reflections on chapter 7 of Search Inside Yourself</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></li>

            <p>Yes. It went well.</p>

        <li><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></li>
        <p>It went well (I think).</p>

        <li><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></li>
        <p>Interesting. It reminds me of the teachings of Mencius (a desciple of Confucius) who reasoned that empathy is what sets us apart from other animals, and that cross species empathy is only achievable by humans. To Mencius, empathy is the foundation of human nature. This theory has been disproven of course because chimps are also capable of empathy (cf Jane Goodall's research etc.).</p>

        <li><strong> Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></li>
        <p>Situation: I was discussing my experience in law with a friend (let's call her Katie as I don't want to use her real name) who has been wanting to pursue a career in law for a long time. She did not have good enough marks to get into law school.</p>

        <p>My perspective: I told my friend that I was not enjoying working as a lawyer and that I felt dirty a lot of the time. I told her that the legal ethics course I did at university was the most practical and useful course because I'm using it everyday (I later found out that most people think the opposite because there's a failure of imagination of what havoc lawyers can make if the lawyer is not ethical). I said to her that lawyering is a profession, and did you know what the first 'profession' of the world is? Prostitution. Prostitutes rent their bodies and lawyers rent their minds. I can't judge my clients, I can only tell them what their lawful options are to achieve their goal (regardless how ethical the goal may be). The worst part of it was the firm I was working had a very unethical boss and I was tormented by my loyalty to my boss (make it more complicated so we can charge more money) and my loyalty to the client (know what they actually want and give it to them). Katie was very shocked and got very angry at me suddenly. I don't understand. And she's stopped talking to me.</p>

        <p>Katie's perspective: lawyers are respectable, upright members of the society and I want to become a 'professional'. My friend Judy has 'made it' in the world of law so maybe she can give me some insight into what it's like to work in the industry. I know I didn't get good enough grade to get into law school but I'm going to try again next year. I am sure my hard work will be rewarded and I will become a lawyer eventually. I was shocked when Judy said that lawyers are prostitutes. How could she say that? Lawyers are nothing like prostitutes who are unethical and breaks families apart. They are respected and trusted professionals. And prostitution isn't a profession. Where did she get that from? Maybe Judy has a mental health problem and I should just distance myself from her. I don't want to surround myself with negative people who are trying to convince me to stop pursuing my dream.</p>

        <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
        <p>I understand that there are other perspectives and that empathy is an important thing. I was at Oxford university in 2014 in a discussion group about empathy. I remember that they said that because I was a domestic violence lawyer, I was 'brimming with empathy'. Empathy seems like a buzz word at the moment and that's great (just like how 'synergy' was a buzz word in the 80s amongst management consulting gurus). However, it is important to hold on to your values too. I have friends who are psychologists and family lawyers who would give up their minds for their clients because they cared too much. You need to remember your reasons for action, or your raison d'Ãªtre in the first place. The point is that even when people are kind and well-meaninged, there can be conflict. And conflict is ok. As long as nobody dies.</p>
