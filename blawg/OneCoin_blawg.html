      <h1>Blockchain and Legal Ethics</h1>

      <p>I recently saw <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/117006835/cryptoqueens-and-scam-goddesses--exploring-fraud-via-podcasts"this article></a> and listened to the podcast of the OneCoin scam and wondered: how did they get away with it? For so long? It seems so incredible that well-educated people are so willing to part with their money as soon as they believe they are making the world a better place. Are humans really that easy to dupe?</p>

      <p>Being the obsessive geek that I am, I researched further. The more I delve into this story however, the more I realised that I think differently. The combination of my interests in philosophical enquiry (Socrates actually said that his job as a philosopher is to be an annoying "gadfly" that persists in asking pointed questions in search of the truth), my background in legal practice and now in infromation security; made me unique. I am not so cynical to have lost faith in human intelligence but I am not so naive as to think that caution is unecessary.</p>

      <p>As I journey further into cybersecurity, I have developed a sense of wonder for great hacks. Instead of being scared of "hackers", I think people need to understand how it was done - the method for their madness. It is the same in law. It is important to study criminal behaviours to defend yourself against them. Trial lawyers talk about having a "theory of the case" so the story makes sense and the crime was committed through rational calculations by the perpetrator (although if you're really that calculating, you wouldn't get caught so easily). So how did they do it?</p>
      
      <p>From my preliminary understanding of cryptocurrency, I knew that a cryptocurrency is only possible because it has a blockchain, rather than an SQL database (basically like a bunch of Excel spreadsheets with columns and rows). Blockchain to me is a whole bunch of computers ("nodes") have the same Excel spreadsheets and it gets updated at the same time when changes are made on the spreadsheets. If you kill a node it doesn't matter because the information is still the same the last time it was changed and you can always get the same information from another node. If you think about it, it is very much like how money works - accountants get killed all the time but the value of what is on their spreadsheets live on (NB: no accountants were harmed in the writing of this blawg post)! Hence, the creation of cryptocurrency (I think).</p>

      <p>But without working on the inside of OneCoin and actually seeing their architecture, how did they find out? I then watched <a href="https://youtu.be/mTCG5jrr4uY">this interview</a> with Bjorn Bjercke, the guy who eventually exposed OneCoin for its lack of an actual blockchain because he was headhunted to create their blockchain. They were looking to hire someone to create a blockchain <em> after </em> they got investments for their fancy new cryptocurrency. In the world of finance, this is allowed because it is assumed that people are rational and can see through the mere puffery before coughing up their hard-earned cash (oh the great Adam Smith! The invisible hand of the market is gloved at times). However, because technological literacy is so low in the general population, people <em>believed</em> the hype and the feel-good dopamine hit in thinking they are making the world a better place. I don't think those blockchain bros, by laughing at these investors, are helping though.</p>

      <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/mTCG5jrr4uY?t=2090">34:50 of the interview</a> I immediately noticed the fundamental rule of legal ethics that a lay person wouldn't have understood - the duty of loyalty as a fiduciary.  </p>

      <p>The most concerning thing is that the supposed "Dr" Ruja was using that rule for unethical means.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>So how should OneCoin have gone about in an ethical way? Crowdfunding. Probably.</p>
